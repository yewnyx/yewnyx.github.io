To be filled in by AutumnVR. Send me or her suggestions! Until then, here's what's in my head. Not at all final - it will probably change completely. I'll replace this when we have something more concrete.

Goal: Conflict and RP.
Non-goal: Getting rid of PVP.

- Don't stream snipe.
  - If you did, don't initiate a fight with them for an hour.
  - You can defend yourself when the shooting starts.
- If you're going to be very violent in general, RP that character and those situations out. RP that itchy trigger finger.
- There aren't any firm rules about offline raiding yet, but it's very cringe.
  - Everyone *will* know what you did.
  - And will get their revenge.
  - And will remember on the next server wipe. :)
  - If anyone is very not OK with this, we can probably work out some sort of protection or something.
- TBD
