# tl;dr

* Have fun roleplaying. If you're going to be a sweaty gamer, RP it.
* Don't be an asshole and don't metagame.
* Your team can have 5 players in it. You can RP alliances or any kind of power relationship.
* Your team can claim land. You can't claim monuments if you don't have complete control of the land surrounding it.
* Your land, your rules.
* Don't offline raid (1/2 of the team offline).
* Fail RP is lame. Don't do that.

# Be A Good Citizen

* Abide by spirit of the server: this is a game and we are all here to have fun. 
* This server is for roleplay - PVP is allowed within RP, but may not be a wise first course of action.
* This is your server too. If you disagree with or don't like something, speak up. It helps to make concrete suggestions.

# Don't Be Shitty

* No harassment, racism, prejudice, bigotry, offensive material, use of hate groups, etc.
  * This includes in voice or text, on signs, in notes, or any other sort of images.
* No cheating or hacking
* Don't stream snipe.
  * If you enjoy watching another player's stream, and they are okay with this, you should wait at least 30 minutes to interact with them, and not use any knowledge you gained from that.
  * If conflict is unavoidable, consider taking the L and putting yourself at a disadvantage to them.
  * If you're raiding someone on Twitch, you'll see their gameplay. Be a good sport and don't take advantage of that.

# Teams

* Your team may have up to 5 players.
* Please declare your team members to Yewnyx so they can be recorded.
* Your team can ally with other teams.

# Territory

* Your team can declare a claim to land up to 100m away from your building(s).
* If you develop small outposts, these do not contribute to your land claim unless you can make it work in RP.
* Agree with other factions on your territory, or agree that it's disputed and work it out any way you like.
  * Ideally, MSPaint on a screenshot of the map or something.
  * If you built something but didn't update the map, the land is still free.
* Monuments (named game areas) are not claimed unless surrounded (use your best judgment. Misunderstandings can be fun anyways).
* Your land, your rules, your responsibility. Your team, or you (if solo), sets your rules. You get to enforce them, too.
  * RP is always allowed. You can allow PVP or even KOS (kill-on-sight), but if you're going to be sweaty killers you're an easy target for people to RP a war against.

# Roleplay and PVP

* No offline raiding (1/2 or more of the other team offline). 
* During a raid, each side are allowed to KOS.
* Raids end when a side retreats, captures/destroys a Tool Cabinet, or both sides agree it's over.
* Have a RP reason for your raids (be creative, for example politics/diplomacy, retaliation, territorial dispute).
* If you repeatedly ignore other teams' rules, you're kind of throwing RP out the window. Lame. Don't do that.
* Try to give people who are just starting a little bit of space, or put extra effort into your RP if you plan on confronting them as an enemy.
