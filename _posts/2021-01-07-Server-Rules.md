# tl;dr

* Have fun roleplaying. If you're going to be a sweaty gamer, RP it.
* Don't be an asshole and don't metagame.
* Your team can negotiate claims to land with other teams (within limits).
* Please declare your team members to Yewnyx so they can be recorded.
* Don't offline raid (1/2 of the team offline).
* Fail RP is lame. Don't do that.

# Be A Good Citizen

* Abide by spirit of the server: this is a game and we are all here to have fun. 
* This server is for roleplay - PVP is allowed within RP, but may not be a wise first course of action.
* This is your server too. If you disagree with or don't like something, speak up. It helps to make concrete suggestions.

# Don't Be Shitty

* No harassment, racism, prejudice, bigotry, offensive material, use of hate groups, etc.
  * This includes in voice or text, on signs, in notes, or any other sort of images.
* No cheating or hacking
* Don't stream snipe.
  * If you enjoy watching another player's stream, and they are okay with this, you should wait at least 30 minutes to interact with them, and not use any knowledge you gained from that.
  * If conflict is unavoidable, consider taking the L and putting yourself at a disadvantage to them.
  * If you're raiding someone on Twitch, you'll see their gameplay. Be a good sport and don't take advantage of that.

# Territory

* Your team can declare a claim to land up to 100m away from your building(s).
* If you develop small outposts, these do not contribute to your land claim unless you can make it work in RP.
* Agree with other factions on your territory, or agree that it's disputed and work it out any way you like.

# Roleplay and PVP

* No offline raiding (1/2 or more of the other team offline). 
* During a raid, and only during a raid, each side are allowed to KOS.
* Raids end when a side retreats, captures/destroys a Tool Cabinet, or both sides agree it's over.
* Have a RP reason for your raids (be creative, for example politics/diplomacy, retaliation, territorial dispute).
* No KOS PVP except as defined above; RP first. If you're spoiling for a fight, escalate it first, and find a way to signal the beginning of PVP hostilities.

# Mutes in RP

* Talkers: Give them a reasonable amount of time to type their replies.
* Mutes: In turn expect to be given time to type things out, and let them know you're typing if it's taking a while. If someone just kills you without RP *they* failed. If you are afraid of not having time to respond to the RP situation, and you surprise them with a fight, you might have won a fight but killed the situation. Instead that's a fat -1 for you, dawg.
