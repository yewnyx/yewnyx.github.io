title: Changes for Next Wipe and Raid Event Announcement
tags: [rust]

# Changes

1. Smelting: To keep pace with the reduced material collection and crafting times, smelting time is halved.
2. Stacking: It has been suggested that I increase item stacking. Doubled.
3. Crafting: The plugin bugged and basically made crafting anything ridiculously fast rather than the intended 2x crafting speed. This has been corrected.

# Upcoming changes 

1. The current map size is 3500; on the next wipe I'll be resetting the size to 2500 or 2700.
2. Backpack: I don't want to give any team too much of an edge, and the server has gotten a lot more people joining it than I expected. It's not going to carry over.
  - Though I initially configured it as such, I don't feel committed to allowing the items to carry over, especially if the mod doesn't initially work on the reset.
  - The devs have stated that the wipe will include blueprint wipes, so it might be good to just start fresh and consider this period of time a tutorial for most of the players.
3. DM: It seems like it could make sense to have a map DM of some sort. Thoughts?

# Raid Event

On Wednesday, beginning at 10PM Pacific, it will be PVP open season. If people have suggestions for a resource drop for people at 8:30PM to prepare, I'll consider the suggestions.
