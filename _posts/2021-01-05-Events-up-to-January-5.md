# Summary of Events

- Autumn faction
  - took Yewnyx (non-ascended) hostage
  - killed Crake and looted hiim
  - Attacked djdeyar on sight. (Note: DJ had previously been declared KOS)
  - Offline raided Zager. (Note: allowed under the rules, but actions have consequences)
- At some point, Brad stole an unknown faction's car, and returned fire (successfully) against Shaye.
- Feeling affronted by the attack, DJ vowed to protect her people and returned to confront Brad, but was mortally wounded, her pride destroyed.
- DJ began a training arc to grow stronger and gather resources, only to find Brad waiting for her return at her base. She snuck in, avoiding capture.
- Unable to defeat his nemesis, Brad returned to Zager and eliminated them in their sleep (the villaiin!).
- Crake misinterpreted DJ's vow of vengeance as DJ having killed Zager, and issued a hit, one that Brad was eager to fulfill.
- Flynn rejoined the server, having previously promised to join the NonaLust faction, and gained access to its base.
- Striking out on his own, he abandoned his promise to form his own faction.
- Knuffle demanded Yewnyx get down from his horse, claiming he was offering a gift. He proceeded to threaten Yewnyx to dismount at gunpoint.
- Yewnyx shot first.
- Flynn, taken aback, said it was ridiculous to shoot first when a gun was pulled, then asked if he pulled a gun whether he would be shot. He pulled a gun and pointed it at Yewnyx.
- Yewnyx shot first.
- Zager logged on for the first time since getting raided, and teamed up with DJ.
- DJ, dedicated to discovering Brad's vulnerability, tailed him for an hour to discover his base.
- DJ's faction retaliated against the Autumn faction with an attack on their base. "Blood for blood", they said, as well as "Fuck you brad".
- Flynn went on a rampage against his formerly promised allies, killing Dotty and Tamara for transgressions as meaningless as annoyance from music-playing.

Djdeyar is appointed the First Apostle of the holy war against the Allies of Autumn and the Faction of Flynn.
