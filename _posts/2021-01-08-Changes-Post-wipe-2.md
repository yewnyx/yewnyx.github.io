1. The previous map was too small at 2400. Expanded to 3000.
2. Backpack items did not carry over.
3. Gather, smelting, and crafting rates will start at 1x and may be tuned according to feedback.
4. As compensation for the reset (and their feedback), players on the previous map were given starting resources.
