A couple of small updates to the changes for post-wipe regarding map size, backpack, and gather, smelting, and crafting rates.
<!--more-->
1. The current map size is 3500; on the next wipe I'll be resetting the size to 2500.
2. Backpack items will **not** carry over.
3. Gather, smelting, and crafting rates will start at 1x and may be tuned, for example to 1.5x or 2x.
